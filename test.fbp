# crashes
PROCESS PORT

# think it's good this is not crashing.
# although it should throw an error when
# we go to the new line.
# sooo, but left hand side is finished.
# anyway noflo's parser also cannot handle this.
# then comes right hand side.
# if that's a whole, then it's correct.
# as far as left hand side is concerned it is correct.
# Basically left hand almost always needs right hand.
# however with the piping it keeps staying on
# the right hand, only similarity is that it returns
# to the root first each time.
